# Tensorflow Mechanics
Rather than trying to teach more about machine learning techniques in general, this focuses more on the mechanics of
tensorflow and how to write much cleaner code using the inference/loss/training pattern. It's almost directly lifted
from the Tensorflow repository, as it's already written and commented quite well.

Definitely read the link below, as it explains most of this quite plainly.
