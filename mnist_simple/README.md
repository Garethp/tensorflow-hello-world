# MNIST Simple
This is the simple example of how to create a program to understand handwritten numbers. It uses the MNIST data set,
and keeps the example as simple as possible. It sacrifices accuracy by not using more advanced techniques, so that
it can be used as a starting point. For a follow on with more techniques and higher accuracy, take a look at the
[MNIST Deep Example](../mnist_deep/).
